**BUILDER DESIGN PATTERN**

The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

Advantages of the Builder Design Pattern:

Provides a clear separation of concerns: The Builder pattern separates the construction logic from the object's representation. It encapsulates the construction steps in the builder class, allowing different representations of the object to be constructed using the same construction process. This separation enhances code readability and maintainability.

Enables the construction of complex objects: The Builder pattern is useful when constructing objects with many optional parameters or configurations. It provides a way to set these parameters step by step, ensuring that the object is only constructed when all necessary parameters are provided. This avoids the problem of telescoping constructors or having multiple constructor overloads.

Improves code readability: The Builder pattern improves the readability of client code by using method chaining. Each method in the builder returns the builder object itself, allowing method calls to be chained together in a fluent and intuitive manner. This results in more readable and expressive code, as the intent of the construction process is clear.

Allows different object representations: The Builder pattern allows the construction of different object representations using the same underlying builder. By varying the construction process or using different builder implementations, it is possible to create different configurations or variations of the same object. This flexibility is useful when dealing with complex objects that have multiple valid representations.

Provides control over the construction process: The Builder pattern gives control over the construction process, allowing validation and complex initialization logic to be performed within the builder. The builder can enforce certain rules or constraints during construction, ensuring that the resulting object is in a valid state. This can be useful for error handling or ensuring consistency.

Supports immutability: The Builder pattern can be used to construct immutable objects. Immutable objects are thread-safe and have other benefits such as easy caching and reusability. By constructing immutable objects through the Builder pattern, you can ensure that the object's state cannot be modified once constructed.
